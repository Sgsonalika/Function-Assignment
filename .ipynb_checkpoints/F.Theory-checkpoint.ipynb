    "the key difference between a function and a method is their association with objects and classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be called independently without being associated with any class or object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are defined using the def keyword.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\")  # Function call\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Output : 'Hello, Alice'\n",
    "\n",
    "Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "A method is similar to a function but is associated with an object or a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are defined inside a class and can operate on the data contained in that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of methods: instance methods and class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are invoked on objects (instances of classes).\n",

    "2 Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Parameters are variables that are specified in a function's definition. They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In the function definition below, x and y are parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "def add(x, y):  # x and y are parameters\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Arguments are the actual values that are passed to the function when it is called. These values are assigned to the corresponding parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In the function call below, 5 and 3 are arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "add(5, 3)  # 5 and 3 are arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "i.Positional Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "These are arguments that are passed in the correct positional order to match the parameters in the function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg:\n",
    "\n",
    "def greet(name, age):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return f\"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\", 25)  # \"Alice\" and \"25\" are positional arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Keyword Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "These are arguments passed by explicitly naming the parameter they correspond to, regardless of their position.\n",
    "Eg:\n",
    "\n",
    "greet(name=\"Bob\", age=30)  # name and age are specified explicitly as keyword arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Default Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "These are parameters that assume a default value if no argument is provided during the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg:\n",
    "\n",
    "def greet(name, age=20):\n",

    "4 What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "The return statement in a Python function serves the purpose of specifying the value or values that the function should output when it is called. It effectively ends the function's execution and sends a result back to the caller. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Purposes of the return Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Returning a Value to the Caller:\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of the return statement is to provide the output of a function to the code that called the function. This output can be stored in a variable, printed, or used directly in an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg:\n",
    "\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "result = add(3, 5)  # result is now 8\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Terminating the Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The return statement also terminates the function's execution immediately. Any code after the return statement will not be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def check_even(number):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if number % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        return True  # Function ends here if number is even\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return False  # This is only executed if the number is odd\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Returning Multiple Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows a function to return multiple values by returning them as a tuple. These values can then be unpacked into variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    quotient = x // y\n",
    "    \n",
    "    remainder = x % y\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return quotient, remainder  # Returns both quotient and remainder\n",
    "\n",
    "q, r = divide(10, 3)  # q = 3, r = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Returning None:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a return statement is used without specifying a value, or if the function completes without a return statement, the function will return None. This signifies the absence of a return value.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return  # Explicitly returning None\n",
    "\n",
    "result = greet(\"Alice\")  # result is None\n",
    "\n",
    "v. Returning from Functions Without a return Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function doesnâ€™t include a return statement, it implicitly returns None when it finishes executing.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def no_return():\n",
    "    \n",
    "    pass  # No return statement\n",
    "\n",
    "result = no_return()  # result is None\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "The return statement in Python functions allows you to output a result to the calling code, terminate the function, and optionally return multiple values or None. It is essential for making functions reusable and integrating their outputs into other parts of the program."

    "i. Iterables:\n",

    "An iterable is any Python object that can return an iterator. It is something you can loop over (e.g., using a for loop). Common examples of iterables include lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, and sets.\n",

    "An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data, returning one element at a time when you call the next() function. Once it returns all elements, it raises the StopIteration exception, signaling that there are no more elements to return.\n",

    "6 Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "generators are a special type of iterable that allows you to iterate over data without storing the entire dataset in memory. Instead, they generate the values on the fly, making them memory-efficient and suitable for large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept of Generators:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Generators produce values one at a time and only when requested, using a mechanism called lazy evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. They are defined similarly to regular functions, but instead of using the return statement, they use the yield statement to return data.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Every time the generatorâ€™s __next__() method is called (via the next() function or a for loop), the generator resumes where it left off (after the last yield), runs until it hits the next yield, and returns the next value.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Generators Work:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. When a generator function is called, it doesnâ€™t execute the function immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. The generator object can be iterated using next() or a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. On each call to next(), the generator function runs until it encounters a yield statement, then it pauses execution and returns the yielded value.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. When the function finishes, a StopIteration exception is raised, signaling that there are no more values to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining a Generator:\n",
    "\n",
    "You define a generator in Python using a function with the yield keyword instead of return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def count_up_to(n):\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "5\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features of Generators:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Lazy Evaluation: Generators compute values only when requested, allowing them to handle large datasets efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def infinite_sequence():\n",
    "    \n",
    "    num = 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        yield num\n",
    "        \n",
    "        num += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Memory Efficiency: \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike lists, generators do not store all values in memory. They yield values one at a time, which is more memory-efficient for large sequences or infinite data streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def generate_squares(n):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        \n",
    "        yield i ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "squares = generate_squares(1000000)  # Memory-efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Single Iteration: Generators can only be iterated over once. After they are exhausted (i.e., after all values have been yielded), they cannot be reused unless the generator function is called again to create a new generator object.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. State Retention: Each time a generator is paused (via yield), it retains its current state, so when resumed, it picks up from where it left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Generator Expressions:\n",
    "In addition to generator functions, you can define generators using generator expressions, which are similar to list comprehensions but produce values lazily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "gen_expr = (x ** 2 for x in range(5))\n",
    "\n",
    "for val in gen_expr:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print(val)\n",

    "1\n",
    "\n",
    "4\n",
    "\n",
    "9\n",
    "\n",
    "16\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences Between Generators and Regular Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators use yield to produce a series of values lazily over time, whereas regular functions use return to produce a single result and then exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular function executes all its code and returns a result at once, while a generator suspends its execution and resumes at the next yield point when next() is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators allow you to generate values on-the-fly using the yield keyword, making them memory-efficient for large or infinite sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "They work through lazy evaluation, meaning they only produce values when needed, rather than computing everything upfront.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator expressions provide a shorthand way to create simple generators, similar to list comprehensions but without holding the entire output in memory."

    "7 What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Memory Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage: Generators generate values on the fly using lazy evaluation. They donâ€™t store the entire dataset in memory like lists or other collections do. Instead, they yield one item at a time, which makes them much more memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: When using a generator to process a large file, only one line is held in memory at a time, as opposed to loading the entire file into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "def read_large_file(file_name):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    with open(file_name) as file:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        for line in file:\n",
    "            \n",
    "            yield line\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Lazy Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage: Generators only produce values when requested (i.e., when next() is called or when iterated over). This means that they donâ€™t compute values until they are needed, which can lead to performance benefits, particularly when the entire dataset is not required at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: You can generate an infinite sequence without running out of memory, as values are computed one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "def infinite_sequence():\n",
    "    \n",
    "    num = 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        yield num\n",
    "        \n",
    "        num += 1\n",
    "iii. Improved Performance for Large Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage: For tasks that involve processing large datasets or streams of data, generators can be much faster than regular functions that return entire collections. Since generators yield items one at a time, the initial overhead is low, and computation is spread out over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Processing each element of a large dataset as needed without waiting for the entire dataset to be prepared.\n",
    "\n",
    "def large_data_processor(data):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for item in data:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        yield process(item)  # Processing each item one at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Simplicity in Representing Infinite Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage: Generators are ideal for representing infinite sequences, as they can yield an infinite number of values one at a time. Regular functions would require creating a large list or another collection, which isnâ€™t feasible for infinite sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Creating a generator that yields Fibonacci numbers infinitely:\n",
    "\n",
    "def fibonacci():\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a, b = 0, 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        yield a\n",
    "        \n",
    "        a, b = b, a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "v. Pipeline Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage: Generators allow you to create pipelines of operations where data is processed in stages. Since generators produce items lazily, each stage of the pipeline processes only the items it needs when it needs them, reducing the overhead of materializing intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: You can chain generators to create a series of transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "def double_numbers(nums):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for num in nums:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        yield num * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "def filter_even(nums):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for num in nums:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        if num % 2 == 0:\n",
    "           \n",
    "           yield num\n",
    "\n",
    "These generators can be combined:\n",
    "\n",
    "nums = range(10)\n",
    "\n",
    "doubled_and_filtered = filter_even(double_numbers(nums))\n",
    "\n",
    "for num in doubled_and_filtered:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "\n",
    "vi. State Retention Across Iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage: Generators automatically retain their state between iterations without needing to store that state externally. This makes them ideal for stateful computations like producing values from a sequence or managing internal counters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A generator that counts down from a number:\n",
    "\n",
    "def countdown(n):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    while n > 0:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        yield n\n",
    "        \n",
    "        n -= 1\n",
    "\n",
    "No need to manually manage the state of n outside the generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "vii. Clean Code for Complex Iteration Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage: Generators help simplify complex iteration logic by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. With regular functions, you might need to build and return large collections of data, whereas generators allow you to abstract away the iteration logic and handle it step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Yielding values from a complex data structure without the need to create and store intermediate results:\n",
    "\n",
    "def walk_tree(tree):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if isinstance(tree, list):\n",
    "        \n",
    "        for subtree in tree:\n",
    "            \n",
    "            yield from walk_tree(subtree)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        yield tree\n",
    "viii. Reduced Initialization Overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage: When a generator is created, the code within it is not executed until its next() method is called. This reduces the initialization overhead because the generator doesnâ€™t perform any computation or produce any values until requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: When processing only a subset of a dataset, a generator wonâ€™t compute all values upfront, unlike a regular function that might return a fully populated list or other collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators provide memory efficiency and improved performance, especially when dealing with large or infinite datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "They implement lazy evaluation, producing items on-the-fly as needed, which reduces computation and memory load.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are ideal for handling complex iteration logic, stateful computations, and constructing efficient pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their ability to represent infinite sequences and reduce initialization overhead makes them more versatile than regular functions for specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "These advantages make generators highly useful in scenarios where memory and performance are critical, such as streaming data, large file processing, and real-time computations."

    "8 What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Unlike regular functions that are defined with the def keyword, lambda functions are typically used for short, simple operations that can be written in a single expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax of Lambda Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of a lambda function is compact and consists of the lambda keyword, followed by a list of parameters, a colon, and an expression. The result of the expression is automatically returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "lambda arguments: expression\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a basic example of a lambda function that adds two numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Characteristics of Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Anonymous: Lambda functions are typically unnamed (though they can be assigned to a variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Single Expression: A lambda function can only contain a single expression (no statements, loops, or multi-line blocks).\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Implicit Return: Lambda functions automatically return the result of the expression they evaluate, without needing an explicit return statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Limited Scope: Because of their compact nature, lambda functions are often used in places where short, temporary, and small functionality is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "->Common Use Cases for Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Used in Functional Programming with map(), filter(), and reduce():\n",
    "Lambda functions are commonly used in conjunction with functions like map(), filter(), and reduce() to apply simple functions to iterable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with map():\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(list(squared))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with filter():\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(list(even_numbers))  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with reduce() (requires functools):\n",
    "\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(product)  # Output: 24\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Used as Short Functions in sorted() and sorted() with key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are often used to specify the sorting logic in functions like sorted() or sort() using the key argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "students = [('John', 75), ('Jane', 82), ('Dave', 66)]\n",
    "\n",
    "####### Sort by the second element (the score)\n",
    "\n",
    "sorted_students = sorted(students, key=lambda student: student[1])\n",
    "\n",
    "print(sorted_students)\n",
    "\n",
    "####### Output: [('Dave', 66), ('John', 75), ('Jane', 82)]\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Used for Quick, Simple Functions Passed as Arguments:\n",
    "Lambda functions are handy when you need to pass a small function as an argument to another function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def apply_func(f, x):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return f(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "result = apply_func(lambda x: x ** 2, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 25\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Used in GUI Programming:\n",
    "Lambda functions can be used for event handling in GUI frameworks like tkinter, where you want to pass a small function to handle a button click or other event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import tkinter as tk\n",
    "\n",
    "def on_click():\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print(\"Button clicked!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "button = tk.Button(text=\"Click me\", command=lambda: on_click())\n",
    "\n",
    "button.pack()\n",
    "\n",
    "v. Used to Replace Small Helper Functions:\n",
    "When a simple function is only used once or has very minimal logic, a lambda can replace a regular function definition to keep the code cleaner and more concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "####### Using lambda instead of defining a separate function\n",
    "\n",
    "func = lambda x: x + 10\n",
    "\n",
    "print(func(5))  # Output: 15\n",
    "\n",
    "->When to Use Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. For Short, Simple Operations: Lambda functions are ideal for situations where you need to perform a small operation that doesn't require a full function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. When Passing a Function as an Argument: Lambda functions are commonly used to pass small functions as arguments to higher-order functions like map(), filter(), or in callback mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. For Inline Use: Lambda functions are convenient when defining quick, throwaway functions that will not be reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "->When Not to Use Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. For Complex Logic: Since lambda functions are restricted to a single expression, they are not suitable for complex logic or operations that require multiple lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. For Readability: If a function's logic is complicated or requires comments and explanation, a regular function defined with def is typically better for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Lambda functions are anonymous, compact, and used for small operations that can be written in a single expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. They are commonly used with functions like map(), filter(), and sorted(), and they are useful for passing quick, temporary functions as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Advantages: They simplify code by eliminating the need for formally defining small, throwaway functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Limitations: Due to their single-expression nature, they should not be used for complex operations where regular functions would provide better readability and structure.\n"

    "9 Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "The map() function in Python is used to apply a specified function to each item of an iterable (like a list, tuple, or set) and returns a map object (an iterator) containing the results. This function allows for concise and efficient data transformation by applying a function to all elements in a sequence without using an explicit loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "map(function, iterable, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "function: The function to be applied to each element in the iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "iterable: The iterable(s) whose items will be passed to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If multiple iterables are passed, the function must take as many arguments as there are iterables, and the function is applied to the corresponding items from all iterables simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "The primary purpose of map() is to transform data by applying a function to every element of an iterable in a clean and functional programming style. It is often used when you need to perform some operation on all elements of a list (or other iterable) and want to avoid writing a loop explicitly.\n",

    "Key Points:\n",

    "i. map() returns a map object, which is an iterator, so it needs to be converted to a list or other iterable (like list(map(...))) to see the results.\n",
    "\n",
